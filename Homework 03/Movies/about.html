    <h1>About our page</h1>
    <p>Netflix is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service. The service primarily
        distributes original and acquired films and television shows from various genres, and it is available
        internationally in multiple languages.[6]

        Launched on January 16, 2007, nearly a decade after Netflix, Inc. began its pioneering DVD‑by‑mail movie rental
        service, Netflix is the most-subscribed video on demand streaming media service, with 238.39 million paid
        memberships in more than 190 countries.[7] By 2022, "Netflix Original" productions accounted for half of its
        library in the United States and the namesake company had ventured into other categories, such as video game
        publishing of mobile games via its flagship service.</p>
