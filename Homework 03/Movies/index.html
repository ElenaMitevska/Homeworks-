    <p>Netflix is an American subscription video on-demand over-the-top streaming service. The service primarily
        distributes original and acquired films and television shows from various genres, and it is available
        internationally in multiple languages.[6]

        Launched on January 16, 2007, nearly a decade after Netflix, Inc. began its pioneering DVD‑by‑mail movie rental
        service, Netflix is the most-subscribed video on demand streaming media service, with 238.39 million paid
        memberships in more than 190 countries.[7] By 2022, "Netflix Original" productions accounted for half of its
        library in the United States and the namesake company had ventured into other categories, such as video game
        publishing of mobile games via its flagship service.</p>

    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>Netflix was founded by Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings on August 29, 1997, in Scotts Valley, California.
        Hastings, a computer scientist and mathematician, was a co-founder of Pure Software, which was acquired by
        Rational Software that year for $750 million, the then biggest acquisition in Silicon Valley history.[8]
        Randolph had worked as a marketing director for Pure Software after Pure Atria acquired a company where Randolph
        worked. He was previously a co-founder of MicroWarehouse, a computer mail-order company as well as vice
        president of marketing for Borland.[9][10] Hastings and Randolph came up with the idea for Netflix while
        carpooling between their homes in Santa Cruz, California, and Pure Atria's headquarters in Sunnyvale.[11] Patty
        McCord, later head of Human Resources at Netflix, was also in the carpool group.[12] Randolph admired Amazon and
        wanted to find a large category of portable items to sell over the Internet using a similar model. Hastings and
        Randolph considered and rejected selling and renting VHS as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship.[9]
        When they heard about DVDs, first introduced in the United States in early 1998, they tested the concept of
        selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings's house in Santa Cruz.[9] When the disc
        arrived intact, they decided to enter the $16 billion Home-video sales and rental industry.[9][11] Hastings is
        often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late
        to return a copy of Apollo 13.[11] Hastings invested $2.5 million into Netflix from the sale of Pure
        Atria.[13][11] Netflix launched as the first DVD rental and sales website with 30 employees and 925 titles
        available—nearly all DVDs published.[11][14][15] Randolph and Hastings met with Jeff Bezos, where Amazon offered
        to acquire Netflix for between $14 and $16 million. Fearing competition from Amazon, Randolph at first thought
        the offer was fair, but Hastings, who owned 70% of the company, turned it down on the plane ride home.[16][17]

        Initially, Netflix offered a per-rental model for each DVD but introduced a monthly subscription concept in
        September 1999.[18] The per-rental model was dropped by early 2000, allowing the company to focus on the
        business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees, shipping and handling fees, or
        per-title rental fees.[19] In September 2000, during the dot-com bubble, while Netflix was suffering losses,
        Hastings and Randolph offered to sell the company to Blockbuster for $50 million. John Antioco, CEO of
        Blockbuster, thought the offer was a joke and declined, saying, "The dot-com hysteria is completely
        overblown."[20][21] While Netflix experienced fast growth in early 2001, the continued effects of the dot-com
        bubble collapse and the September 11 attacks caused the company to hold off plans for its initial public
        offering (IPO) and to lay off one-third of its 120 employees.[22]

        DVD players were a popular gift for holiday sales in late 2001, and demand for DVD subscription services were
        "growing like crazy", according to chief talent officer Patty McCord.[23] The company went public on May 29,
        2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at US$15.00 per share.[24] In 2003, Netflix was issued a patent
        by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office to cover its subscription rental service and several extensions.[25]
        Netflix posted its first profit in 2003, earning $6.5 million on revenues of $272 million; by 2004, profit had
        increased to $49 million on over $500 million in revenues.[26] In 2005, 35,000 different films were available,
        and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day.[27]

        In 2004, Blockbuster introduced a DVD rental service, which not only allowed users to check out titles through
        online sites but allowed for them to return them at brick and-mortar stores.[28] By 2006, Blockbuster's service
        reached two million users, and while trailing Netflix's subscriber count, was drawing business away from
        Netflix. Netflix lowered fees in 2007.[26] While it was an urban legend that Netflix ultimately "killed"
        Blockbuster in the DVD rental market, Blockbuster's debt load and internal disagreements hurt the company.[28]

        On April 4, 2006, Netflix filed a patent infringement lawsuit in which it demanded a jury trial in the United
        States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Blockbuster's online DVD rental
        subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix. The first cause of action alleged Blockbuster's
        infringement of copying the "dynamic queue" of DVDs available for each customer, Netflix's method of using the
        ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers, and Netflix's method permitting the queue to be
        updated and reordered.[29] The second cause of action alleged infringement of the subscription rental service as
        well as Netflix's methods of communication and delivery.[30] The companies settled their dispute on June 25,
        2007; terms were not disclosed.[31][32][33][34]

        On October 1, 2006, Netflix announced the Netflix Prize, $1,000,000 to the first developer of a
        video-recommendation algorithm that could beat its existing algorithm Cinematch, at predicting customer ratings
        by more than 10%. On September 21, 2009, it awarded the $1,000,000 prize to team "BellKor's Pragmatic
        Chaos."[35] Cinematch, launched in 2000, is a recommendation system that recommended movies to its users, many
        of which they might not ever had heard of before.[36][37]

        Through its division Red Envelope Entertainment, Netflix licensed and distributed independent films such as Born
        into Brothels and Sherrybaby. In late 2006, Red Envelope Entertainment also expanded into producing original
        content with filmmakers such as John Waters.[38] Netflix closed Red Envelope Entertainment in 2008.[39][40]</p>

    <h2 id="transition to streaming services">Transition to streaming services</h2>
    <p>In January 2007, the company launched a streaming media service, introducing video on demand via the Internet.
        However, at that time it only had 1,000 films available for streaming, compared to 70,000 available on DVD.[41]
        The company had for some time considered offering movies online, but it was only in the mid-2000s that data
        speeds and bandwidth costs had improved sufficiently to allow customers to download movies from the net. The
        original idea was a "Netflix box" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By
        2005, Netflix had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service. But after witnessing how popular
        streaming services such as YouTube were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a
        hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept.[42] In February 2007, Netflix delivered its
        billionth DVD, a copy of Babel to a customer in Texas.[43][44] In April 2007, Netflix recruited ReplayTV founder
        Anthony Wood, to build a "Netflix Player" that would allow streaming content to be played directly on a
        television rather than a desktop or laptop.[45] Hastings eventually shut down the project to help encourage
        other hardware manufacturers to include built-in Netflix support, which would be spun off as the digital media
        player product Roku.[46][47][48] In January 2008, all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited
        streaming at no additional cost. This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new
        video-rental services.[49][50][page needed] In August 2008, the Netflix database was corrupted and the company
        was not able to ship DVDs to customers for 3 days, leading the company to move all its data to the Amazon Web
        Services cloud.[51] In November 2008, Netflix began offering subscribers rentals on Blu-ray and discontinued its
        sale of used DVDs.[52] In 2009, Netflix streams overtook DVD shipments.[53] On January 6, 2010, Netflix agreed
        with Warner Bros. to delay new release rentals to 28 days after the DVDs became available for sale, in an
        attempt to help studios sell physical copies, and similar deals involving Universal Pictures and 20th Century
        Fox were reached on April 9.[54][55][56] In July 2010, Netflix signed a deal to stream movies of Relativity
        Media.[57] In August 2010, Netflix reached a five-year deal worth nearly $1 billion to stream films from
        Paramount, Lionsgate and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The deal increased Netflix's annual spending fees, adding roughly
        $200 million per year. It spent $117 million in the first six months of 2010 on streaming, up from $31 million
        in 2009.[58] On September 22, 2010, Netflix launched in Canada, its first international market.[59][60] In
        November 2010, Netflix began offering a standalone streaming service separate from DVD rentals.[61] In 2010,
        Netflix acquired the rights to Breaking Bad, produced by Sony Pictures Television, after the show's third
        season, at a point where original broadcaster AMC had expressed the possibility of cancelling the show. Sony
        pushed Netflix to release Breaking Bad in time for the fourth season, which as a result, greatly expanded the
        show's audience on AMC due to new viewers binging on the Netflix past episodes, and doubling the viewership by
        the time of the fifth season. Breaking Bad is considered the first such show to have this "Netflix effect." [62]
        In January 2011, Netflix announced agreements with several manufacturers to include branded Netflix buttons on
        the remote controls of devices compatible with the service, such as Blu-ray players.[63] By May 2011, Netflix
        had become the largest source of Internet streaming traffic in North America, accounting for 30% of traffic
        during peak hours.[64][65][66][67] On July 12, 2011, Netflix announced that it would separate its existing
        subscription plans into two separate plans: one covering the streaming and the other DVD rental
        services.[68][69] The cost for streaming would be $7.99 per month, while DVD rental would start at the same
        price.[70] In September 2011, Netflix announced a content deal with DreamWorks Animation.[71] In September 2011,
        Netflix expanded to countries in Latin America.[72][73][74] On September 18, 2011, Netflix announced its
        intentions to rebrand and restructure its DVD home media rental service as an independent subsidiary called
        Qwikster, separating DVD rental and streaming services.[75][76][77][78][79] On October 10, 2011, Netflix
        announced that it would retain its DVD service under the name Netflix and that its streaming and DVD-rental
        plans would remain branded together, citing customer dissatisfaction with the split[80][81] In October 2011.
        Netflix and The CW signed a multi-year output deal for its' television shows.[82] On January 4, 2012, Netflix
        started its expansion to Europe, launching in the United Kingdom and Ireland.[83] In February 2012, Netflix
        reached a multi-year agreement with The Weinstein Company.[84][85] In March 2012, Netflix acquired the domain
        name DVD.com.[86] By 2016, Netflix rebranded its DVD-by-mail service under the name DVD.com, A Netflix
        Company.[87][88] In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political
        action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC.[89] Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers tweeted that the intent was
        to "engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA" .[90][91] In June 2012, Netflix signed a
        deal with Open Road Films.[92][93] On August 23, 2012, Netflix and The Weinstein Company signed a multi-year
        output deal for RADiUS-TWC films.[94][95] In September 2012, Epix signed a five-year streaming deal with
        Netflix. For the initial two years of this agreement, first-run and back-catalog content from Epix was exclusive
        to Netflix. Epix films came to Netflix 90 days after premiering on Epix.[96] These included films from
        Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate.[97][98] On October 18, 2012, Netflix launched in Denmark, Finland,
        Norway and Sweden.[99][100] On December 4, 2012, Netflix and Disney announced an exclusive multi-year agreement
        for first-run United States subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action
        films, with classics such as Dumbo, Alice in Wonderland and Pocahontas available immediately and others
        available on Netflix beginning in 2016.[101] Direct-to-video releases were made available in 2013.[102][103] On
        January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros.
        Television to distribute Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim content, as well as TNT's
        Dallas, beginning in March 2013. The rights to these programs were given to Netflix shortly after deals with
        Viacom to stream Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. Channel programs expired.[104] For cost reasons, Netflix stated that
        it would limit its expansion in 2013,[105] adding only one new market—the Netherlands—in September of that year.
        This expanded its availability to 40 territories.[106][107]
